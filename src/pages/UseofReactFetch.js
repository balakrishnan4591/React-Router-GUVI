        <h2>Use ReactJS to Fetch and Display Data from API – 5 Simple Steps</h2>
        In this blog, we’ll learn how to fetch and display data from APIs and
        use it in a ReactJS app. There are multiple ways to fetch data in a
        React application, and we’ll walk you through those methods. With the
        help of APIs, we can fetch the data from servers and display it in our
        application. Let’s first understand what an API is. API stands for
        “Application Programming Interface”, which is a method of communication
        between different applications. ReactJS is an open-source
        JavaScript-based library developed by Facebook used to create web
        applications’ user interfaces. As ReactJS is dynamic in nature, we can
        get the data using APIs and display it in our application. To render
        some data in our front end, we either need a backend to store our data
        and then make use of the data, or we can simply use APIs to have some
        mock data while building an application. When we use APIs, we don’t need
        a backend and are also not required to build anything from scratch.
        Mostly, we use the REST API or the GraphQL API to access the data added
        to the server. Before we go into depth, we should understand how an API
        works.
        <h3>How does an API work??</h3> The workings of an API are very easy to
        understand. Here’s an example, say we want to build a new application
        but don’t have our own backend. Now, to display the news in our
        application, we need some third-party APIs to access their backend
        server and display the data in our app. Now, there are three things we
        must have noted: an application, a server, and an API. Most times, the
        API is in between the app and server because whenever the client
        requests the data, the API makes a GET request to the server and sends
        that back to the application for display. environment typically includes
        a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom) and various
        tools and plugins for debugging, linting, and code formatting. Android
        Studio or Xcode: To build and run React Native applications on specific
        platforms, you need the respective native development tools. Android
        Studio is required for building Android applications, while Xcode is
        needed for building iOS applications. Emulators or Physical Devices:
        React Native applications can be tested and debugged using emulators
        (e.g., Android Emulator, iOS Simulator) or connected physical devices.
        React Native Libraries and Dependencies: React Native provides a set of
        built-in components and APIs for building user interfaces, accessing
        native device features (e.g., camera, location, sensors), and more.
        Additionally, developers can use third-party libraries and packages from
        the React Native ecosystem to add additional functionality to their
        applications. Setting up the React Native environment can be a bit
        involved, especially for beginners, as it requires installing and
        configuring multiple tools and dependencies. Once the environment is set
        up correctly, developers can use it to create, develop, test, and build
        React Native applications that can run seamlessly on both Android and
        iOS platforms, sharing a large portion of the codebase between the two
        platforms. Are you prepared to learn full-stack development? Join GUVI’s
