        <h2>ReactJS Architecture: A Comprehensive Guide For Developers</h2>
        The world of full-stack development is vast and consists of a lot of
        libraries and frameworks that help you make outstanding websites with
        ease. One such important framework is ReactJS. If you are someone new to
        this, no worries, you will learn everything about ReactJS architecture
        in this article. By the end of this article, you will be gaining
        invaluable knowledge about ReactJS architecture that gives you the
        freedom and flexibility to work on the backend. So, without further ado,
        let’s get started.
        <h3>What is ReactJS Architecture?</h3> The foundation is stronger for
        any building to stand tall and mighty. So, we’ll be starting out
        learning the journey of ReactJS architecture right from its definition.
        Imagine you’re building a house. You have different parts like the
        kitchen, living room, bedrooms, etc. Each part has its own purpose and
        can be designed separately, but they all come together to form a
        complete house. ReactJS architecture is like this house. It’s a way of
        organizing and structuring a web application using React, a popular
        JavaScript library. In this “house,” we have components, state
        management, and a one-way/unidirectional flow of information. When you
        combine components, state management, and one-way data flow, you get a
        clear and organized structure for building your web application. This is
        what we call ReactJS architecture. It helps developers create
        applications that are easy to build, maintain, and scale. So, to put it
        simply, ReactJS architecture is like designing and building a house with
        different rooms (components), a smart home system (state management),
        and a simple plumbing system (one-way data flow) to keep everything
        running smoothly. Talent Acquisition Experts Talent acquisition
        specialists work in the human resources field and assist organizations
        in finding and hiring the right talent. They meet with management to
        identify job openings, participate in the interview process, and assist
        with onboarding new hires. Interpersonal skills, professional
        communication, knowledge about the company, and experience working with
        diverse teams are essential for this role. This is one of the best
        non-coding jobs in blockchain and is a great option for you if you’d
        like to stay close to blockchain but still not deal with the technical
        bits too much. Talent acquisition experts earn an average salary of
        around ₹5 to ₹10 lakhs per year. 8. Business Developers Business
        developers play a crucial role in boosting the growth and sales of
        blockchain startups. They conduct market research, develop business
        strategies, build client relationships, and identify new business
        opportunities. Excellent sales tactics, strong communication skills,
        marketing abilities, and the ability to work under pressure are
        essential for this role. Business developers can earn an average salary
        scale of ₹6 to ₹12 lakhs per year. Takeaways… In conclusion, the
        blockchain industry offers a plethora of non-coding job opportunities
        for professionals from various backgrounds. These roles come with higher
        salaries, greater growth prospects, more freedom, and the chance to
        pursue your passion. However, before proceeding, make sure you fully
        understand the foundational ideas of computer networking, data
        structures, and programming. A great resource that will
