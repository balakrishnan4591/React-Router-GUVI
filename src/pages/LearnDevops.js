        <h2>How Long Will It Take to Learn DevOps?</h2>
        Are you fascinated by the ever-evolving world of DevOps and the seamless
        integration of development and operations? Do you aspire to become a
        master of automation, continuous delivery, and cloud technologies? If
        you’ve ever wondered how long it would take to become a DevOps expert,
        you’re not alone. DevOps has revolutionized the way modern businesses
        deliver software, enabling faster, more reliable deployments and
        enhancing collaboration among teams. But just how much time and
        dedication does it require to navigate the complex subject of DevOps
        successfully? In this article, we explore ways to become a DevOps
        engineer in months by understanding the key skills, challenges, and
        factors that impact the learning timeline. Without further ado, let’s
        get started.
        <h3>Becoming a DevOps Engineer in 3 Months: 30-40 hours a week</h3>{" "}
        Becoming a DevOps engineer in just three months is an ambitious goal,
        but it’s possible with dedication and consistent effort, especially if
        you can devote 30-40 hours a week to learning and practicing. Here’s a
        structured plan to help you achieve your goal: Month 1: Foundations
        devops foundations Understand DevOps Concepts: Start by learning about
        the core principles, practices, and methodologies of DevOps. Familiarize
        yourself with Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD),
        version control, automation, and infrastructure as code. Version Control
        Systems: Get hands-on experience with popular version control systems
        like Git. Learn how to create repositories, commit changes, manage
        branches, and collaborate with others on code. Linux Basics: DevOps
        engineers commonly work on Linux-based systems. Learn the basics of
        Linux commands, file system navigation, permissions, and shell
        scripting. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Explore tools like Terraform or
        Ansible to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
        Practice creating and managing infrastructure resources in a cloud
        environment. Before we move to the next part, you should have a deeper
        knowledge of DevOps concepts. You can consider enrolling yourself in
        GUVI’s DevOps Career Program, which lets you gain practical experience
        by developing real-world projects and covers technologies including
        Agile, Scrum, Linux, Git, Bash Scripting, Dockers, Containers, AWS
        infrastructure, etc. Additionally, if you would like to explore AWS
        Infrastructure through a Self-paced course, try GUVI’s AWS
        Infrastructure for Beginners certification course. Month 2: CI/CD and
        Automation Continuous Integration (CI): Dive deeper into CI concepts and
        set up CI pipelines using popular DevOps tools like Jenkins or GitLab
        CI/CD. Learn how to build, test, and deploy code changes automatically.
        Containerization: Learn about containerization with Docker. Understand
        how to create Docker images, manage containers, and build containerized
        applications. Container Orchestration: Familiarize yourself with
        Kubernetes, the leading container orchestration platform. Learn how to
        deploy, scale, and manage applications in Kubernetes clusters.
        Monitoring and Logging: Explore monitoring and logging tools like
        Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
        Understand how to collect, analyze, and visualize system and application
        metrics. Month 3: Advanced Topics and Projects Cloud Services: Choose a
        cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, and gain proficiency in
        their core services. Learn how to deploy and manage applications in a
        cloud environment. Security in DevOps: Understand security best
        practices for DevOps, including secure coding, access controls, and
        compliance. Learn about security tools like OWASP ZAP and SonarQube.
        High Availability and Scalability: Study techniques to design highly
        available and scalable systems. Learn about load balancing,
        auto-scaling, and fault tolerance. Final Project: Work on a real-world
        DevOps project that involves building, deploying, and managing a web
        application using the tools and practices you’ve learned. This will give
        you hands-on experience and something to showcase to potential
        employers. Remember, consistency is key, and you must practice regularly
        to reinforce your learning. 3 months is a short duration to master
        DevOps but if you are sincere about it, you can achieve it. Seek out
        certified online courses, and hands-on labs to supplement your
        knowledge. Additionally, participate in DevOps communities, forums, and
        meetups to learn from others and gain insights into industry best
        practices. experience working with diverse teams are essential for this
        role. This is one of the best non-coding jobs in blockchain and is a
        great option for you if you’d like to stay close to blockchain but still
        not deal with the technical bits too much. Talent acquisition experts
        earn an average salary of around ₹5 to ₹10 lakhs per year. 8. Business
