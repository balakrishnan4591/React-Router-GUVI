          How to Build a Command Line Interface with Node.js: A Complete Guide
        </h2>
        The world of full-stack development is vast and consists of a lot of
        libraries and frameworks that help you make outstanding websites with
        ease. One such important framework is ReactJS. If you are someone new to
        this, no worries, you will learn everything about ReactJS architecture
        in this article. By the end of this article, you will be gaining
        invaluable knowledge about ReactJS architecture that gives you the
        freedom and flexibility to work on the backend. So, without further ado,
        let’s get started.
        <h3>What is CLI?</h3> CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It is a
        text-based interface used to interact with a computer’s operating system
        or software applications by entering commands as text input. The CLI
        provides a way to execute tasks, navigate directories, manage files and
        directories, and run programs or scripts. In contrast to a Graphical
        User Interface (GUI), which uses visual elements like windows, icons,
        and menus, the CLI requires the user to type in specific commands and
        follow a structured syntax. This makes it more efficient and powerful
        for advanced users, system administrators, and developers who need to
        perform complex or repetitive tasks. Examples of CLIs include: Terminal
        or Console on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
        or PowerShell on Windows Bash (Bourne Again SHell) or other shell
        environments Python or Ruby interactive shells for programming languages
        CLIs are often used for tasks such as system administration, scripting,
        automation, file management, version control, and software development.
        While they may have a steeper learning curve compared to GUIs, CLIs
        offer more flexibility, control, and efficiency for advanced users.
